       "AIMessage(content='Fractional real estate refers to a model of property ownership where multiple individuals or entities share ownership of a single property. This arrangement allows investors to purchase a fraction or percentage of a property rather than the entire asset, making real estate investment more accessible and affordable.\\n\\nHere are some key features of fractional real estate:\\n\\n1. **Shared Ownership**: Multiple owners hold a share of the property, which can range from a small percentage to a larger portion, depending on the investment structure.\\n\\n2. **Cost-Effective**: By sharing the cost of purchasing and maintaining a property, investors can enter the real estate market with a lower financial commitment.\\n\\n3. **Usage Rights**: Owners typically have specific rights to use the property, which may be allocated based on the percentage of ownership or through a predetermined schedule.\\n\\n4. **Management**: Fractional ownership often involves a management company that handles the day-to-day operations, maintenance, and rental of the property, relieving individual owners of these responsibilities.\\n\\n5. **Investment Potential**: Owners can benefit from property appreciation and rental income, similar to traditional real estate investments, but with a lower initial investment.\\n\\n6. **Legal Structure**: Fractional ownership can be structured in various ways, including limited liability companies (LLCs), partnerships, or through real estate investment trusts (REITs).\\n\\nFractional real estate is commonly used for vacation homes, luxury properties, and investment properties, allowing individuals to enjoy the benefits of real estate without the full financial burden.', additional_kwargs={'refusal': None}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 299, 'prompt_tokens': 17, 'total_tokens': 316, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 0}}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_0ba0d124f1', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, id='run-d25dca98-ee9f-4425-933f-dfebd6f8a2e5-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 17, 'output_tokens': 299, 'total_tokens': 316, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 0}})"

    "## Streaming in LLMs\n",
    "\n",
    "All language model interfaces (LLMs) in LangChain implement the `Runnable` interface, which provides default methods such as `ainvoke`, `batch`, `abatch`, `stream`, and `astream`. This setup equips all LLMs with basic streaming capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Streaming Defaults:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Synchronous Streaming:** By default, streaming operations return an `Iterator` that yields a single value, the final result from the LLM provider.\n",
    "- **Asynchronous Streaming:** Similarly, async streaming defaults to returning an `AsyncIterator` with the final result.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- These default implementations do not support token-by-token streaming. For such detailed streaming, the LLM provider must offer native support. However, the default setup ensures that your code expecting an iterator of tokens will function correctly within these constraints.\n"

      "A mortgage is a type of loan specifically used to purchase real estate, where the property itself serves as collateral for the loan. When a borrower takes out a mortgage, they agree to repay the loan amount, plus interest, over a specified period, typically 15 to 30 years. Mortgages are commonly used by individuals and families to buy homes, but they can also be used for investment properties or commercial real estate.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Key Components of a Mortgage:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Principal**: The original loan amount borrowed from the lender.\n",
      "2. **Interest**: The cost of borrowing the principal, expressed as a percentage of the loan amount. This can be fixed (stays the same throughout the loan term) or variable (can change at specified times).\n",
      "3. **Term**: The length of time over which the loan must be repaid, commonly 15, 20, or 30 years.\n",
      "4. **Down Payment**: The initial amount paid upfront by the borrower, usually expressed as a percentage of the property’s purchase price. A larger down payment can reduce the loan amount and may eliminate the need for private mortgage insurance (PMI).\n",
      "5. **Amortization**: The process of gradually paying off the loan through regular payments, which cover both principal and interest.\n",
      "6. **Escrow**: An account where funds are held for property taxes and insurance, which are often included in monthly mortgage payments.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Types of Mortgages:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Fixed-Rate Mortgage**: The interest rate remains constant throughout the loan term, providing predictable monthly payments.\n",
      "2. **Adjustable-Rate Mortgage (ARM)**: The interest rate may change after an initial fixed period, leading to fluctuating monthly payments.\n",
      "3. **Interest-Only Mortgage**: The borrower pays only the interest for a certain period, after which they begin paying both principal and interest.\n",
      "4. **FHA Loans**: Insured by the Federal Housing Administration, these loans are designed for low-to-moderate-income borrowers and require lower down payments.\n",
      "5. **VA Loans**: Available to veterans and active-duty military personnel, these loans often require no down payment and have favorable terms.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Pros of Mortgages:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Homeownership**: Mortgages enable individuals to purchase homes without needing the full purchase price upfront.\n",
      "2. **Equity Building**: As you make payments, you build equity in your home, which can be a valuable asset over time.\n",
      "3. **Tax Benefits**: Mortgage interest payments may be tax-deductible, depending on local laws and regulations.\n",
      "4. **Fixed Payments**: With a fixed-rate mortgage, monthly payments remain stable, making budgeting easier.\n",
      "5. **Leverage**: Mortgages allow you to leverage your investment, meaning you can control a larger asset with a smaller amount of your own money.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Cons of Mortgages:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Debt Obligation**: A mortgage is a long-term debt that requires consistent payments, which can be a financial burden.\n",
      "2. **Interest Costs**: Over the life of the loan, the total interest paid can be substantial, often exceeding the original loan amount.\n",
      "3. **Risk of Foreclosure**: If you fail to make payments, the lender can foreclose on the property, leading to loss of your home.\n",
      "4. **Market Fluctuations**: Property values can decrease, potentially leaving you with a mortgage balance higher than the home’s market value (underwater mortgage).\n",
      "5. **Additional Costs**: Homeownership comes with other costs, such as property taxes, insurance, maintenance, and repairs, which can add to the financial burden.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion:\n",
      "\n",
      "A mortgage can be a powerful tool for achieving homeownership and building wealth over time. However, it also comes with significant responsibilities and risks. It’s essential for potential borrowers to carefully consider their financial situation, the terms of the mortgage, and the long-term implications before committing to a mortgage. Consulting with financial advisors or mortgage professionals can help individuals make informed decisions."
